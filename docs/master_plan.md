## Phase 3: GUI Development and Final Testing

### Objective
Develop a Graphical User Interface (GUI) and conduct comprehensive testing before deployment.

#### GUI Development
- **Task: Integrate GUI with Backend**
  - Develop a GUI that integrates with the existing backend and manage multithreading effectively.

#### Data Visualization Enhancement
- **Task: Implement Data Visualization Tools**
  - Use CSV Editor plugin and data visualization libraries to present data accessibly.

#### Final Testing
- **Task: Ensure System Integrity**
  - Perform extensive testing to ensure the system is reliable and address any identified issues.

#### User Documentation and Tutorials
- **Task: Facilitate User Adoption**
  - Develop user guides and tutorials explaining system navigation and features.

## Phase 4: Advanced Development and Deployment

### Objective
Refine the system with advanced features and prepare for deployment.

#### Advanced Git Usage
- **Task: Manage Features with Branching**
  - Adopt branching and merging to develop new features while maintaining codebase stability.

#### Code Refactoring
- **Task: Enhance Code Quality**
  - Regularly refactor the codebase to improve readability, structure, and performance.

#### Final Deployment
- **Task: Launch the Application**
  - Deploy the fully tested and documented application and monitor post-deployment feedback.

how can i have these notes in pycharm?
ChatGPT

To keep these notes in PyCharm, you have a couple of options:

    Markdown File:
    PyCharm supports Markdown files, so you can directly create a .md file with these notes. Here's how:
        Open PyCharm.
        In the Project Explorer, right-click the directory where you want to create the file.
        Select 'New' and then 'File'.
        Name your file with a .md extension, for example, DevelopmentPlan.md.
        Paste the markdown content into this file.

    Comments in Code:
    You can also include these notes as comments in your Python code. This way, they're directly accessible within the relevant files. Just copy the text (not in markdown format) and paste it as a comment (using # for single-line comments or ''' ''' for multi-line comments).

    PyCharm Scratch Files:
    PyCharm has a feature called 'Scratch Files' for temporary notes or drafts:
        Go to 'File' > 'New Scratch File'.
        Select 'Markdown' from the list of languages.
        Paste the markdown content into the scratch file.

    PyCharm TODOs:
    PyCharm can keep track of all your TODO comments in the code. You can insert your notes as TODO comments, and PyCharm will list them in the 'TODO' tool window:
        In your code, write a comment like # TODO: Implement Main Menu System.
        Open the 'TODO' tool window (usually found at the bottom of the IDE) to view all your TODOs.

Choose the method that best fits your workflow and preferences!
